# Knux's Miscellaneous Tools
A small repository containing simple C# code that I hack together to either make some of the stuff I do easier or just to test some stuff.

The stuff here heavily relies on [Marathon](https://github.com/Big-Endian-32/Marathon), specifically my [custom Ninja fork](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Marathon/tree/ninja), the SonicNext functions may also need the [NvTriStripper](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Marathon/blob/ninja/Marathon.Shared/Resources/Libraries/NvTriStripDotNet.dll) as well? Haven't actually tested them here.
